A deep learning-based application that identifies bird species from both images and audio recordings. It uses MobileNetV2 for efficient image classification and CNN models trained on spectrograms/MFCCs for audio analysis. 
Built with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Librosa, and integrated into a Flask web app for real-time predictions. Trained on datasets like CUB-200, Xeno-Canto, and BirdCLEF.
